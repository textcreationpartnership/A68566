1. A BRIEFE DISCOVERY OF THE VNTRVTHES, AND SLANDERS AGAINST Reformation, and the fauourers thereof, contained in D. Bancrofts Sermon.

    _ D. BANCROFTS TEXT. 1. Iohn 4.1. Dearely beloued, beleeue not euery ſpirite, b••••ie the ſpirites, whether they be of God: For many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world

    _ D. BANCROFT. Pag. 8. line. 10. Laſtly, they are falſe Prophetes, who do peruert the meaning of the Scriptures, for the maintenance and defence of any falſe doctrine, ſciſme, of hereſie. Herof you know, I might giue you many examples. I pray you beare with me if I ſet downe, one as ſtrange in my opinion, as any to be found in a matter of no great importance. The name of falſe prophets, I am content in diuers reſpects to ſuppreſſe. The matter it ſelfe, which I meane, ſtandeth in this ſort. There are many nowe a daies who doe affirme, that when Chriſt vſed theſe wordes: DTC ECCLESIAE.Math. 18 He meant hereby to eſtabliſh in the Church foreuer, the ſame plot and forme of Eccleſiaſticall Gouernement to be en•ct in euery pariſh which Moſes by 〈…〉 counſell, appointed in mount Sinay:Numb. 11. and which afterward; the•• was did imitate in their particular Sinagogues.

    _ D. BANCROFT page 9. They had ſay theſe men in their ſinagogues, the • prieſts, we muſt haue in euery pariſh our paſtors, they their Leuite, we our Doctors, they their rulers of their ſinagogues, we our Elders, they their leuittical treaſurers, we our Deacons.

    _ M. BANCROFT. This forme of gouernement, they cal the tabernacle, which God hath appointed, the glory of God, and of his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, the preſence of God the place which he hath choſen to put hi• name there, the courte of the Lord, and the ſhining forth of Gods glory.

    _ D. BANCROFT page 6. line 13. VVhere this eccleſiaſtical Synod is not erected, they ſay Gods ordinance is not performed: the office of Chriſt as he is a King, is not acknoledged: in effect, with out this gouernement, we can neuer attaine to a right and trewe feeling, of chriſtian religion, but are to be reckoned among thoſe,Luke. 19.27. who ſay of Chriſt, we wil not haue this man to raigne ouer vs.

    _ D. BANCROFT page 10. ſect. 2. & 3. There was neuer ancient father (as I thinke) ſince the Apoſtles time, that did thus expound the place, Mat. 18. Beſides there hath bin a diuers gouernement from this, vſed in the Church euer ſince the Apoſtles time, and theſe men doe confeſſe, that this gouernment long before the counſel of Nice began greatly to decay and that ſince the ſayd counſel,T. C. it was neuer heard of in the world, vntil theſe their times.

    _ D. BANCROFT page 10. & 11. A very ſtrange matter if it were true, that Chriſt ſhould erect a forme of gouernment to continue vntil his comming, and that the ſame ſhould neuer be once put in practiſe, for the ſpace of 1500. yeares, or at the leaſt (to take them at their beſt) that the gouernment & kingdome of Chriſt ſhould then be ouerthrowne, when the diuinity of his perſon the honour of his kingly authors, &c. was eſtabliſhed at the counſel of Nice.

    _ D. BANCROFT page 17.18.19. & 20. But the ſtory of Aerius is moſt pertinent, to ſhew that ambition driueth men to be falſe Prophets. Epiphanius doth report it thus in effect. Euſtathius and Aerius ſtroue one againſt another for a Biſhopricke.Lib. 3. Tom. 1. haereſ. 75. Euſtathius obtained it, whereat, Aerius began to repine, and grewe to bee a ſciſmatike, defending that by the word of God, there was no difference betweene a Prieſt and a Biſhop. Hee vſed the ſame arguments that now are vſed of theſe that maintaine his opinions. As that the Apoſtle writing ſometimes to prieſts and deacon, ſometimes to Biſhops and deacons ſhoulde thereby ſignifie, that a Biſhop and a prieſt is al one. In concluſion, Aerius after due tryal, and examination, had by the learned fathers, who then liued of his arguments and ſleight, was by the generall conſent, of the Church overthrowne, and condemned for an heretick. And to this day there was neuer any but heretikes, and ſuch lewde perſons that condemned the callings of Lord Biſhops for Antichriſtian.

    _ D: BANCROFT page 33. lin. 26. & pag. 34. lin. 19. & 41. lin. 17. The popiſh falſe Prophets wil ſuffer the people to try nothing, but teach them wholly to depend vppon them. The giddy ſpirits woulde haue men to be everſeeking and ſearching. The meane therefore betwixt both theſe extremities I holde to be beſt. And this it is, that when you haue attained the true grounds of Chriſtian Religion, and are conſtantly built by a liuely faith vpon Ieſus Chriſt,1. Cor. 3. being incorporated into his miſ••eal body, by your baptiſme, and afterwards nouriſhed with the Lords Supper: you then content your ſelfe and ſeeke no farther, &c.

    _ D. BANCROFT page 42. & 43 line 24. God hath bound himſelfe vnto his church of purpoſe, that men by hir good direction,Councels. might in this point (that is in maters of dout) be relieued: to whoſe godly determinatiō, in maters of queſtion, her dutiful children, ought to ſubmit themſelues without any curious or wilfull contradiction. Neither can I ſee, nowe that popery is banniſhed, and the trueth of chriſtian religiō is godly planted amongſt vs, why in theſe dais, we ſhuld not attribute as much to the decrees of our learned fathers in their lawfull aſſemblies, as other men in times paſt, of as great iudgement as wee are, haue done.
